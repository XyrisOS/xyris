 * @brief Ports header file. Provides inline functions
 * for getting and setting values at different ports.
 * An I/O port is usually used as a technical term for
 * a specific address on the x86's IO bus. This bus
 * provides communication with devices in a fixed
 * order and size, and was used as an alternative
 * to memory access. (https://wiki.osdev.org/I/O_Ports)
